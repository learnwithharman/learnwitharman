# Edu Monk - Stylish Landing Page 🌐

## 📌 About the Project
Edu Monk ek simple **HTML + CSS landing page** hai jo maine web development seekhne ke liye banaya.  
Pehle version me sirf HTML tha (basic structure), lekin ab maine **modern CSS** add karke design ko stylish aur interactive banaya hai.  
Is project ka main purpose tha **HTML + CSS basics ko practically samajhna** aur ek real-world landing page ka demo create karna.  

## ✨ Key Highlights
- 🏗️ Clean HTML structure with responsive layout
- 🎨 Custom CSS for styling (dark theme + neon accents)
- 🔝 Fixed navbar with glassmorphism effect
- ⚡ Hero section with heading, description & buttons
- 📊 Features & Stats section (card hover effects included)
- 🦶 Footer with links & branding
- 👨‍💻 Beginner-friendly code, easily extendable with JS
