# Edu Monk - Simple HTML Landing Page 🌐

## 📌 About the Project
Edu Monk ek simple **HTML based landing page** hai jo maine web development seekhne ke liye banaya.  
Is project ka main idea tha ek clean aur minimal page banana jisme header, hero section aur footer jaise basic parts ho.  
Isme koi advanced CSS/JS nahi hai, sirf plain HTML use hua hai taaki basics clear ho aur structure samajh aaye.  

## ✨ Key Highlights
- 🏗️ Pure HTML structure (no CSS, no JS)
- 🧩 Basic sections included (Header, Hero, Features, Footer)
- 👨‍💻 Beginner-friendly code
- 🚀 Can be extended later with CSS/JS for styling and interactivity
